Surprisingly enough Kenneth Hughes directed it, which came as a real shock because his greatest cinematic conquest prior to this was the children\u0027s classic CHITTY, CHITTY, BANG, BANG! Here in his last movie before his demise in 2001, he attempts to join the ranks of Hitchcock and Carpenter and create a harrowing portrayal of a city in fear from a psychopathic headhunting assassin. But does he succeed in jumping from one end of the movie chain to the other without getting a little confused in-between?\n\nIt\u0027s all set in Boston, around Wendell College\u0027, a suspicious night school where it seems a sadistic and ruthless butcher is targeting a number of the students for headless (!) assassination. Lieutenant Judd Austin (Leonard Mann) is put on the case and finds a prime suspect in professor Millet (Drew Snyder), a flirtatious anthropology lecturer who seems to have quite an interest in the young attractive female co-ed\u0027s extra curricular activities! However the police are left with no clues and no witnesses to each bizarre murder and find themselves struggling to come to terms with the fact that they are dealing with an extremely intelligent serial killer. Before long decapitated bodies begin to turn up all over town and Judd realises he must do everything in his power to stop this deranged butcher from striking again\n\nI\u0027m having trouble finding out when this was actually released. The Roman numerals on the cover of my print state a production date of 1979, the IMDB say it was 1981 and the All Movie Guide\u0027 reckon 1980? At a guess I\u0027d say \u002781 but I may well be wrong. I\u0027ll do my best to try and find out more\n\nUnlike many of the genre films from this period, this manages not to imitate HALLOWEEN too much, but instead owes more to Italian Giallo movies and Hitchcock\u0027s PSYCHO. Hughes makes us well aware of his love for the later by including a remake of the notorious shower scene from that movie. Here Rachel Ward is washing, when all of a sudden in the background the door opens and through the curtain we see a silhouetted figure creeping up on her. It\u0027s effective in showing us that the director was well aware that he was making a slasher movie and he enjoyed using the obvious clichés that were apparent even that early in the cycle. You immediately notice that the guy behind the lense is a man with an experienced past, it\u0027s competently shot and surprisingly well budgeted. He also manages to pile on some suspense in a number of scenes, my favourite being the aftermath of the brutal murder of a female café waitress. The next day the owner turns up to find his restaurant in a mess. We already know by viewing the first two murders that the killer submerges the decapitated heads of his victims in the nearest pool of water, so we\u0027re already expecting him to find a shocking sight somewhere or other! As he begins clearing up the tables and chairs, two builders arrive and ask him to heat up some food for them. He places a large saucepan on the hob, which is filled with stew and warms them up a snack. They tuck in, and one of them finds a hair in his bowl! By now you\u0027re cringing thinking surely it wasn\u0027t in therewas it? The chef continues chatting and pours the remainders of the pan down the sink. You\u0027re on the edge of your seat expecting to see a blood-splashed head roll out at any minute! I wont tell you what happens, but the tension it creates is excellent.\n\nThe bogeyman has got to be one of the most violent slayers that I have ever seen. He repeatedly slashes his victims with a large machete before beheading them. In one bit, he cuts one unlucky girl to shreds, splashing pints of her blood all over the clear white walls as he goes! This must\u0027ve been the scene that helped get the film added to the video nasties list and I can see why, it\u0027s one of the most disturbing things I\u0027ve ever witnessed in a horror film. (The CHITTY, CHITTY, BANG, BANG similarities were wearing pretty thin by now!)  He looks pretty creepy too, in shiny black motorcycle leathers and tinted helmet to conceal his identity. There are some genuinely macabre moments on show, including him dragging his machete along a wire fence creating an eerie clanking sound and one unlucky teen finding a gory head in her toilet! It\u0027s also worth noting that Dario Argento lifted a number of parts from this for arguably his greatest ever feature TENEBRAE from 1982. This is most evident at the beginning, when the demented worker guy follows Rachel Ward\u0027s character home from the café. It\u0027s almost identical to an early scene in Argento\u0027s flick, right up to the dog jumping up and barking at a wire fence! That in it\u0027s self is a huge compliment for any director.\n\nSadly though, what really came close to being an unsurpassed classic is let down by poor cinematic balancing. Though the murder scenes are brutal, effective and brinking on the verge of ingenious sleaziness, the rest of the runtime feels sloppy and meritless with some comically inept scripting and dialogue.  There\u0027s no real plot twist at the end and the butcher\u0027s identity is far too easy to solve, offering no challenge for all the junior Agatha Christies among us! The general acting is also mediocre especially from Ward who doesn\u0027t manage to excel herself in her first silver screen role. She certainly had the looks, but all the charisma of a dead fish! I\u0027m afraid that these minor problems prevent TERROR EYES from shinning as much as it could have done and it\u0027s a real shame.\n\nThe net result is an above average thriller with some interesting ideas and some chillingly effective set pieces. Unfortunately it falls slightly short of true greatness and fails to live up to its at times all too sleazy surroundings. However, it still comes highly recommended to any slasher follower as a neat example of the genre\u0027s peak period and many a horror fan will find fulfilment in the brutality of the demented bogeyman. It\u0027s not bad, but just at times a bit of a disappointment"  },  "duration": "PT1H28M"}</script><script>    if (typeof uet == 'function') {      uet("bb", "LoadCSS", {wb: 1});    }</script>  <script>(function(t){ (t.events = t.events || {})["csm_head_pre_css"] = new Date().getTime(); })(IMDbTimer);</script>        <!-- h=ics-c52xl-7-1e-f8c79570.us-east-1 -->            <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/imdb/css/collections/title-flat-v2-3342886420._CB451700989_.css" />        <noscript>            <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/imdb/css/wheel/nojs-2827156349._CB470041026_.css">        </noscript>  <script>(function(t){ (t.events = t.events || {})["csm_head_post_css"] = new Date().getTime(); })(IMDbTimer);</script><script>    if (typeof uet == 'function') {      uet("be", "LoadCSS", {wb: 1});    }</script><script>    if (typeof uex == 'function') {      uex("ld", "LoadCSS", {wb: 1});    }</script><script>    if (typeof uet == 'function') {      uet("bb", "LoadJS", {wb: 1});    }</script><script>    if (typeof uet == 'function') {      uet("bb", "LoadHeaderJS", {wb: 1});    }</script>  <script>(function(t){ (t.events = t.events || {})["csm_head_pre_ads"] = new Date().getTime(); })(IMDbTimer);</script>                <script  type="text/javascript">            // ensures js doesn't die if ads service fails.              // Note that we need to define the js here, since ad js is being rendered inline after this.
